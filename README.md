## Environment Setup

Setting Up the Environment
Before diving into the data analysis, it's essential to set up our environment by installing all necessary Python packages. This includes `pandas` for data manipulation, `sqlite3` for interacting with SQLite databases, `openai` and `langchain` for leveraging LangChain's capabilities, and other packages that will be used throughout this notebook.

```bash
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install scikit-learn
pip3 install pandas-datareader
pip3 install plotly redis
pip3 install langchain langchain-experimental
pip3 install openai
pip3 install tiktoken
pip3 install faiss-cpu
pip3 install openai
pip3 install SQLAlchemy
pip3 install load_dotenv
```
